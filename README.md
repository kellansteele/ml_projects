# Kellan's Streamlit App for Machine Learning Projects
A streamlit app which allows you to explore some of my ML projects.

![Object Detection Page](/media/thermal_page.png)

In this app you will find information on image annotation (creating ground truths) for object detection datasets and some examples of image pre-processing steps using OpenCV.

In addition, there is an example of a YOLOv5 model I trained to detect people and dogs in thermal images.
